## About

This is the result of my exploration of printable, and specifically alphanumeric shellcode.
While the code is not optimal in any way and maybe not very clear, this project is just to demonstrate what is possible and push my shellcoding skills. Somebody might find it interesting too.
As a bonus, the string "Hello, World!\n" is not directly present in the assembled code.

> Please don't try to use this as a start for your own project. I'm sure there are a hundred better ways of implementing something like this.
